A SMS interface for Dropbox

We built Droplet, SMS interface for Dropbox to streamline the on-the-go Dropbox experience. For quick interactions, our minimalist interface provides easy access to your files. We are excited about the applications of Droplet for those with feature phones or low access to Internet. We also see wide applicability for companies like news organizations to broaden their reach and user engagement.
